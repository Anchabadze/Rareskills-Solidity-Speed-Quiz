# Syntax Quiz

The Solidity Syntax Quiz is a collection of problems that tests engineers on intermediate-level Solidity syntax. After teaching hundreds of Solidity engineers -- including professional ones -- we've seen that many tend to struggle to produce answers quickly to the kinds of problems in this quiz.

By practicing these problems, you'll be more fluent in areas you might not have had much practice with in the past.

None of these problems require any clever "tricks" to or "hacks" to solve. If you understand the underlying concept, these problems are straightforward.

Your goal should not just be to answer the questions, but to be able to answer them quickly. What is covered here is still essential solidity syntax, so you want fluency with it.

After you solve the problems, we suggest trying again a week later to test if you internalized the concepts and syntax.

**Suggestion**: turn off your IDE's AI feature when using this repo.
